This is my Capstone Project that tracks the golf rounds you play. You can add the location, number of holes, what you shot and your course rating. It will save the items in an array until you use the 'delete' button

I used 'Cors' and 'Express' for this project so you will need to run 'npm i' to get those dependencies installed.

After they are installed you will need to run 'nodemon' to get the server running and you should be good to go!
